  <h1>Single-user JupyterHub Dockerfiles</h1>
</div>

This is a collection of single-user JupyterHub Dockerfiles for Docker images that are designed to be spawned by the [JupyterHub Docker Spawner](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). These Dockerfiles do not include the Conda package manager (Dockerfiles by the Jupyter Development Team containing Conda [here](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks), under the images directory).
