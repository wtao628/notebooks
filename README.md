# Single-user JupyterHub Dockerfiles

This is a collection of single-user JupyterHub Dockerfiles for Docker containers that are designed to be spawned by the [JupyterHub Docker Spawner](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). These Dockerfiles do not include the Conda package manager (Dockerfiles by the Jupyter Development Team [here](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks), under the images directory).
